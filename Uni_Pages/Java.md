#####Lists

#####Trees

#####AVL Trees



###Collection classes and Java Type Systems

#####Sets and Maps

#####Interfaces

#####Subtyping

#####Generics



###GUI classes

#####Event Handling



###Threads and Networks

######Syntax for thread class



```java

public class ThreadA extends Thread {

    public void run() {
      //some stuff
    }

}

```

######Interruption

Need to allow for threads to be interrupted - does this by adding __throws InterruptedException__to method declaration.
  


This is then caught as follows:



```java

public void run() {

    try{



      //method body goes here



    }

    catch (InterruptedException e)  {



      //perform clean up



    }



}



```


####Synchronized

* every object has an intrinsic lock associated with it

* if a method is `synchronised` it automatically obtains the lock when the method is invoked and releases it when the method returns

* it is not possible for two synchronized methods _of the same object_ to execute at the same time

* if we use the `synchronized(myObject);` statement this allows for only acquiring the lock on the object for as long as it is needed.  __Need to make sure I understand the example on Tutorials website__

*  if an object is visible to more than one thread, all reads or writes to that object's variables are done through `synchronized` methods

####Deadlock and Starvation



Need to make sure that I can spot deadlock in code as well as describing with a practical example.
